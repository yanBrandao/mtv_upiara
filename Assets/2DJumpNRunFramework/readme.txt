Hello and thank you for buying this framework.
This is an early version of the framework so please report any issues in the Unity Forum Thread .
If you want some specific features you can also post them, but please understand that I can only implement them if they are useful for everybody (except they are easy to do, then I do them anyway :).

If you created something with this framework I would like to see it! So please show me your works, if you want :)

You'll find a quick documentation in the "Manual" folder!

Have a good time and rock on!
